## Settings
This project was developed uses Code Blocks 16.1 version. 
This project uses the [GAlib](http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/) as a generic library for the genetic algorithm, therefore, first check that the library is compiled on your computer. After that, you should have added GAlib.a to the project.

In CodeBlocks you should go to: **Project Option -> Build options -> Click Option Debug -> Linker settings tab -> Add -> OK**
